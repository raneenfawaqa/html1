            Beat the eggs: in a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

     
     </li><li>
         Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil,

     </li><li>
         Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.

               
         </li>
         <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        </li>
          

         
     
     
     <li>
         Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
      
         </li>
         <li>
             Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
